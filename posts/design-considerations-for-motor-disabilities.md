## As a Developer

* All functionality must be available using only the keyboard.
* Links, buttons, and controls must have a visible `:focus` state and should have a visible `:hover` state.

## As a Designer

#### Buttons and Links

* Include focus and hover states in your designs! ðŸ‘€
* Click targets should be **LARGE**

#### Session Timeouts
* Warn users before time expires and give an option to extend the session.
* Give at least **2 minutes** for the user to respond to the warning message
