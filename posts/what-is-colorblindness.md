For most people with colorblindness, it means difficulty distinguishing between certain colors. In rare cases it can mean an insensitivity to all colors.

#### Red-Green (Deuteranopia and Protanopia)

* The most common form of colorblindness
* Reds and greens are difficult to distinguish

#### Blue-yellow (Tritanopia)

* Blues and yellows are difficult to distinguish

#### Grayscale (Achromatopsia)

* All colors appear as shades of gray, black, and white

Red-green colorblindness is the most common.

It is also common to use the colors red-green colors to mean "bad"-"good" or "on"-"off", but [do not rely only on those colors to communicate](https://blissful-brown-5e79ef.netlify.app/posts/design-considerations-for-color-blindness/).
