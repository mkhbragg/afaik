Most design and development considerations for deafness relate to rich media, like videos.

#### Critical

* ðŸŽ¥ All videos must have captions
* ðŸŽ§ All audio content must have transcripts

#### Nice to have
ðŸ¤Ÿ Sign language interpretation of videos can be helpful for people who communicate primarily via sign language.

## As a Designer

* Brainstorm cool ways to incorporate captions in video content! You never know what you might discover.

## As a Developer

* Ensure that the video player widget you're using has captioning capabilities.
* Ask your product team for a transcript to embed in the UI.

**Remember**, including text via transcripts and captions can enrich everyone's experience, not just deaf users. ðŸŒˆ
