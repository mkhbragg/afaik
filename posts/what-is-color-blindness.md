For most people with colorblindness, it means difficulty distinguishing between certain colors. In rare cases it can mean an insensitivity to all colors.

#### Red-Green (Deuteranopia and Protanopia)

- The most common form of colorblindness
- Reds and greens are difficult to distinguish

#### Blue-yellow (Tritanopia)

- Blues and yellows are difficult to distinguish

#### Grayscale (Achromatopsia)

- All colors appear as shades of gray, black, and white

#### Red-black

- Reds and black are difficult to distinguish.

It is common to use red-green colors to mean bad-good or on-off, but [do not rely only on those colors to communicate](/posts/design-considerations-for-color-blindness/).
