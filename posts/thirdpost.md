# **Do not use color alone to communicate information.**

That's it! Super easy. Colors are SO much fun, but they become less fun when you can't differentiate between them.

### As a Designer

* Convey information with text and symbols as well as color.
* Try checking your designs using a simulator (ðŸ‘‡ see below)

### As a Developer

* If you find yourself coding up designs that rely on color, kindly let your designers know!
