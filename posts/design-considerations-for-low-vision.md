## As a Developer

- Do not disable the pinch-to-zoom feature
- Text must meet a minimum contrast threshold with the background
- Controls must have visible `:focus` and `:hover` states
- There should be a clear visual distinction between content and controls

## As a Designer

- Confirm that the colors you've chosen have sufficient contrast
- Include designs for focus and hover states on all controls
- Make sure controls are distinct! Links should look clickable.
