## As a Developer
* Do not disable the pinch-to-zoom feature
* Text must meet a minimum contrast threshold with the background
* Controls must have visible `:focus` and `:hover` states
* There should be a clear visual distinction between content and controls

## As a Designer
* Confirm that the colors you've chosen have sufficient contrast
* Include designs for focus and hover states on all controls
* Make sure controls are distinct! Links should look clickable.
